Nominal - works okay.

src/rp2_common/hardware_xosc/xosc.c b/src/rp2_common/hardware_xosc/xosc.c

startup_delay * 64 - all targets

Only qtpy target got a SPI clock DIV change (from 2 to 4).

Feather (including this very UF2 in this directory)
already has that (SPI clock DIV of 4 not 2).

 $   cat ../../../17-camelforth-b.d/pico-sdk/src/boards/include/boards/adafruit_feather_rp2040.h  | grep DIV

#define PICO_FLASH_SPI_CLKDIV 4
