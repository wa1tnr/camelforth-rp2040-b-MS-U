Built May 7th, first build 'ever'.

Assumes A3 (aka GPIO26) has a red LED singleton connected;
harmless to not do so.

This is the expected blinkenlight for forth words such
as 'pip' or 'blink'.

QTPy does not have an onboard monochrome LED.  Instead, it
has a NeoPixel WS2812B RGB LED (on GPIO12).

Note that GPIO11 controls power to that RGB LED. ;)
